sleep disorder analysis & prediction
this repo has a notebook where i dive into a sleep health dataset to figure out what’s up with sleep disorders and how stuff like age, occupation, bmi, and activity relate to it.

what you’ll find here:

cleaning the data (filling missing sleep disorder info, splitting blood pressure into two parts, dropping useless columns)

exploring data with cool charts to see patterns in gender, sleep quality, stress, and more

turning text categories into numbers for machine learning

checking how features relate using a correlation heatmap

libraries used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

check out the notebook for all the steps and visuals :)
